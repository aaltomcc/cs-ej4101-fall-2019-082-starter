#About me as Fitech student

I am 50 years old Senior Manager in the ICT business area and have been leading several product development teams. Currently I'm between jobs and decided to take some courses to improve my programming skills to be able to work also as an expert. I haven't been programming since year 2000 when I was doing C, C++, ODBC and SQL based system integration for data warehouses. 

Since beginning of September I have been programming with python, Django, javascipt, HTML and CSS. I have completed course in IoT and also in server side web services. Now I'm studying client side web service programming.
