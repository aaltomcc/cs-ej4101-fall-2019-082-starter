# This course CS-E4101 Introduction to DevOps
When I have been working as product development team leader we have been implementing several DevOps like steps without officially using DevOps. By attending this course my goal was to get a clear view and understanding of DevOps with the right terminology and methodology.  I was also hoping to get recommendations for further reading and to learn where to go next in order to obtain more knowledge.The most important reasons for attending this course were:

- getting clear understanding of DevOp principles and methodology
- getting to know the most common tools used to support DevOps
- learning where to get more information to know more
- get some practical experience in how to use DevOps

## What I have learned on this course
Basically I learned the main principles of DevOps and the reasoning for why it should be used to get competitive edge for your business. I learned the about the terms used in DevOps and got some information to be able study further. My goal is to get good knowledge of DevOps in order to be able either lead or be part of a team using it.

What was difficult? I think the questions in the questionnaries were quite difficult compared to the video material we were watching. The questions and answers were really detailed and because english is not the first language of mine I had to read those several times in order to really understand the meaning. I think the question were set in a way that really required thinking thoroughly and were quite close so called tricky questions.

And one possibly a bit stupid personal preference would have been to read more detailed desciption of DevOps instead of going back and forth with the videos which were quite vague compared to get questions. I think the man in the videos was explaining some really basic reasoning so slowly that it sometimes got me really frustrated. When I had to go back watching those videos again to find answers to some questions in the questionnaire I was almost planning to give up. But I didn't.

Anyway, the course was Introduction to DevOps and I was introduced. Now I have to take the next steps in learning DevOps.
